# Theory of Automata and Computing #
This repository contains notes about the Theory of Automata and Computation in Spring 2017. It is for 3 credits. There are no prerequistites to the class. It is a core class for grad school in computer science. 

_PRO TIP : THERE ARE 4 EXAMS, BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO GIVE 3. SO MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR FIRST 3 ON POINT._

__THIS CLASS WILL BE USING D2L. DO KEEP CHECKING OFTEN FOR ANOUNCEMENTS.__

## About the instructor ##
The instructor is Edward Jung.

_But Kshitij, how do I contact him?_
Excellent question. He can be reached at __J-385__ physically or can be reached at (678)915-5546 via phone.
You can also email him at __ejung4@kennesaw.edu__. 

_Key Note_ : For course related materials please contact him at the D2L email. Which he checks ~~everyday~~ all through the week but not on weekends and holidays.

The office hours are Monday and Wednesday, 1430 hours to 1545 hours and 1645 and 1830 hours.

## The Syllabus ##
* Part I: Finite Automata, Regular Expressions, Regular Languages
* Part II: Pushdown Automata & Context Free Languages
* Part III: Turing Machines & Undecidability
* Part IV: Intractable Problems(P vs NP; NP-completeness)
